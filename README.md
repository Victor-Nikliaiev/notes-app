# Note App

This project is an instance of the well-known Note App :D
But the thing is, I've kept functionality as it is expected similar; here is "add" and "delete" note(might be "edit" but for now I desided to use it as soon as I would create apps with some back-end). Here is not any back-end like databases in use. I just used Local Storage for saving notes.
What I did additional. I worked a bit on design to make it intertaining. Also it was used Lorem Picsum API to generate random background picture every time as the page was updated. This app has responsive design.

> Summary of tecnologies that have been used:

1. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) it cost me some pane :D (I've been used it not for a long while) But I like it and understand benefits of using this super-set.
2. [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
3. [React.Js](https://reactjs.org/) (useState, useEffect) and conditional rendering.
